# skitgubbe
This is a replica of the game [skitgubbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skitgubbe) made in pure javacript and some JQUERY. It is of course web based, and can be opened using any web browser (probably not internet explorer though, but at least the modern ones). Hope you find it fun! You can look at the code too if you wonder how things were made!

### Running the program
Simply clone and open the html file.
